# Memory Map

An overview of the memory of the TKey. See [Hardware](/hw) for how to
use the hardware functions.

## Addressing

```
31st bit                              0th bit
v                                     v
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

- Bits [31 .. 30] (2 bits): Top level prefix (described below)
- Bits [29 .. 24] (6 bits): Core select. There is space for 64 cores.
- Bits [23 ..  0] (24 bits): Actual memory or in-core address.

## Assigned Top Level Prefixes

The first 2 bits in a 32-bit address.

## Hardware functions

The hardware functions begins at `0xc000_0000` but please use the
constants in
[tk1_mem.h](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-libs/blob/main/include/tkey/tk1_mem.h)
in the `tkey-libs` repository if you can.

*Note*: The address in the table below is the word address. The data might
be available only in the first bits or maybe the LSB of the word. Also
note that some data is readable only by word, not byte addressing.
Note the description.

In the following table **r** mean read, **r/w** means read and write
access, **i** means invisible.
