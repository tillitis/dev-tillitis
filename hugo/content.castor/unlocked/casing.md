# Casing
Once you have completed the provisioning of your TKey Unlocked, it is
time to glue the case around it. There has been two cases in
production and depending on which one you have, the glue needed are
slighly different.

The reason the glue has to be different is due to factors such as
adhesiveness and blooming. This depends on the plastic used and you
can get two completly different results depending on the glue chosen,
both astetic and the fact how well the parts stick together.

The glue is not today provided in the order of a TKey Unlocked, but
has to be purchased separately. Below you can find the recommended
glue, other brands might also work but since we have not tested them
we cannot guarantee the longterm adhesiveness or the blooming effect. 

## Injection-molded Case
From December 2023 this is the case all TKeys are shipped with. This
casing has improved durability, production quality and asthetics.

### Tech Sheet
- Production method: Injection-molded
- Material: PA12-Grilamid TR 90 Transparent
- Color: Transparent, blasted

### Glue
Recommended glue: Bostik Born2Bond Light Lock, MV. (or similar
cyanoacrylate adhesive)

This is an dual-curing cyanoacrylate adhesive that cures with the help
of contact and UV-light. If you have an UV-lamp it will help it cure
faster, but it is enough from the UV-light that are present around you
all the time.

This is an cyanoacrylate adhesive, but is non-toxic. Hence it can be
glued without special tools or knowledge - but be aware, it dries
quickly so you can easily glue your fingers together.

#### Instructions
1. Apply glue on the back of the TKey, along the pads on both sides.
2. Place the TKey centered in the bottom case (without the ant) with
the pads pointing into the case.
3. Apply glue in both U-shaped grooves on the top part (with the ant)
. You don't need much. Also put a drip of glue in each hole on the key
chain loop.
4. Push the top case (with the ant) onto the bottom case, make sure
the TKey is placed correctly inside the case so it closes properly.
5. Keep a bit of pressure, just so the parts are fully closed. If you
have a UV-lamp, light it now.
6. The curing time depens on if you have a UV-lamp or not, keep
preasure until the glue has cured.

If you don't have a UV-lamp, you can help it curing faster by moving
closer to a window. The curing time wihtout a UV-lamp should still be
less than a minute.

## 3D-printed Case
This is the first production case, and provided before December of
2023.

### Tech sheet
- Prodction method: SLA 3D-printed
- Resin: Formlabs Clear Resin (SLA)
- Color: Translucent white

### Glue
Recommended glue: Bostik Born2Bond Ultra, LV. (or similar instant
adhesive)

This is an instant adhesive, but is non-toxic. Hence it can be glued
without special tools or knowledge - but be aware, it dries quickly so
you can easily glue your fingers together.

#### Instructions
1. Put the TKey in the bottom case (without the ant)
2. Apply a few drips of glue all the way around the outer edge of the
bottom case. You don't need much!
3. Push the top case (with the ant) onto the bottom case
4. Keep a bit of preasure for 20 seconds. You don't have to press
hard, just so the parts are fully closed.
5. You are done!
